The first time I read this http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html it was so revealing for me. I want to become a hacker. Then, through years of development training I missed that feel, there is no more to connect with past, with the true hackers, with the original ones.

When I read this post https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/ I have the feeling again. 

I think those are great tools:

```
ls
find
grep
ack
vim
awk
sort
column
gcc
perl
make
gdb
valgrind
ltrace
lsof
pmap
diff
patch
mercurial
git
tmux
tree
```
