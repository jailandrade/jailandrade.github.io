When I started working with Git in some personal projects always had used this sequence:

{% highlight shell %}

git status # to show the changes
git add # to add the files 
git commit -m 'Feature finished or bug solved' # to commit the files
git push # if I want to upload to the remote repository

{% endhighlight %}

When I started working in some projects with other people I knew that I had to learn to use branchs. And then I had learn to use tags. It was amazing because I learned to build something in team, feature by feature.

I know that may people love and use another tools for versioning, but like someone who tried to utilize several of these tools I recommend git because think itâ€™s more easy to understand.
